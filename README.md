<h4>GFind helps you to find users and organizations in Github.</h4>
<p>It also gives you brief information about that user profile, which includes name, location, hireable, bio, followers, gists, recent repos, and much more. I made it using React and used Context API for state management and work with Github API for this project.</p>
